# Rails on Notes

This is a simple notes app that is my playground for evaluating the latest Ruby on Rails and Vue.js. Feel free to take a look, but don't expect to mutch here.

## How do I get this all to run

* Clone this repository.

* Change to the directory where you cloned the repository and run:

```bash
bundle install
```

* Do the rails database migrations:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

* Run the rails development server:

```bash
rails server
```

* Go to your browser and open the page http://localhost:3000 to see the notes app.
